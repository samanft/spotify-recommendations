# PLEASE READ BEFORE TRYING TO LOG INTO THE WEBSITE
Due to the Spotify API's requirements, applications must be approved for public usage, which takes some time. Thus, Spotify accounts must be manually whitelisted before being able to be used with the website. As a solution to this, I have provided a public account down below. This allows you to bypass the waiting period for individual whitelisting and enjoy the application's features right away:

Should you prefer personal access or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me through email at saman.farasattalab@gmail.com. I'm here to assist with the manual whitelisting process or address any inquiries you might have.
