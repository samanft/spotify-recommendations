# Spotify Recs

Spotify Recs is a web application that provides music recommendations based on a user's top artists and tracks from Spotify.

**Please note:** Due to the way the Spotify API works, you need to be manually whitelisted by me before being able to use the application for yourself. Spotify needs to manually approve the application for public usage, which can take some time. If you wish to be whitelisted, please send a message to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saman-farasat-talab-566634282/).
